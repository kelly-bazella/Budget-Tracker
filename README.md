# Budget-Tracker

## Purpose

The purpose of the budget tracker app is so that a user can track how much money is going in and out of their account. The user can use the application with a internet connection and automatically record their transaction history, or the user can use the app offline and once online again the database will update with their information. 

The purpose of this is to solidify my knowledge of PWAs or Progressive Web Applications.

## How to Use

The user will input a title for the transaction and the ammount. That will then be sent to a database and stored. If the user is offline the information will be stored in cache, then when there is internet connection again the cached information will be loaded into the database.
